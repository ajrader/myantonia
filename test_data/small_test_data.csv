"""A bit about me: I have a master's in math from NYU, and I'm currently making over $96,000 a year working as a web developer. I also run my own web design business, which has become more successful and I am looking to expand -- purchase more equipment, and hire one web developer to work with me.  I decided to get a loan for two reasons:   1) to provide a safety net for me to expand my business. I am currently getting larger projects than I have in the past, and I will need to get another person to help me finish them. Once these projects are done, this investment should pay for itself.  2) I want to establish a lending history with installment loans so that in the future, banks will be able to lend me greater amounts than I am asking for now.  Over the past five years, I have always paid my credit cards on time and that earned me ... well, a score of 729 on Experian, (766 and 768 on TransUnion and Equifax), so I guess you can see I'm a pretty low risk. When I looked at Lending Club I realized that on this site, I could get better terms that I could at any bank! So I decided to post my listing here.  Thank you for reading my request. If you have any questions at all, feel free to contact me on here.""","[17, 168, 171, 173]",Income and Credit Scores
"""My son attends a private school for kids with ADD. It's sad to me that our public school systems are such a mess that they could not provide a good education to my high IQ son. Our only option locally was an expensive private school. We've made it through almost two fulls years of expensive school payments, until now! This is his last year and then next year will attend a public high school. The school has been instrumental in allowing him to be able to do so. Without it, I'm not sure what we would have done!  Just need a little help to get him through the rest of the year.   The revolving credit balance is incorrect. It shows up that way because I have a first and a second mortgage on my house. It is not “credit card” debt.   Thanks for considering my request.""",[9],PHI
